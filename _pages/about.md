## About Me 👨‍💻🚀

I am a **PhD student** in the Computer Science faculty at the **Technion**, advised by [Ehud Rivlin](https://research.google/people/ehud-rivlin/) and [Chaim Baskin](https://chaimb.cs.technion.ac.il/).  

I hold a **BSc** and **MSc** from the **Electrical and Computer Engineering** faculty at the Technion. Alongside my research, I serve as a **reviewer** for top-tier conferences and journals, including **ICCV, ICML, WACV, and TMLR**.  

### 🔬 Research Interests  
My research revolves around **learning under constraints**, tackling challenges such as **semi-supervised learning, noisy labels, active learning with annotation budgets, and limited compute resources**. I'm also passionate about **representation learning, model robustness, Vision-Language models, and efficient AI**.  

Beyond research, I **teach Computer Vision and Deep Learning** to academic professionals—feel free to check out our course at [cs236781](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236781/).  

### 🤝 Let's Connect!  
I'm always open to discussions, collaborations, and research inquiries. Feel free to reach out!
