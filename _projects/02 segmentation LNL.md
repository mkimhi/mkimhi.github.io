This is actually a line of projects relate to our publication about spatial noise effects on instance segmentation models: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10891 


One project is to estimate and analize [grounding SAM]((https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything)) noise to the COCO-WAN benchmark.

Two more (research projects) focus on combat the noise with loss and seperation aproach.
